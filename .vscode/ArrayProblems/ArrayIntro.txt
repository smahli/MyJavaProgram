What is Array ?
____________________

* An Array is an object that holds a
  fixed number of values of homogeneous or
  similar data types/

* or An array is a data structure where 
  we store similar elements

* The length of an array is assigned when
 the array is created and after creation
 its length is fixed.

 for examole : int a[] = new int[6] ;

 Features of an Array
 __________________________

* A java array variable can be declared
like other variables with [] after the data type.

* The variables in the array are ordered and each have an index begining from
0.

* the direct superclass of an array type is object.

* they are always created at the runtime.

* the length of an array can be found by using member " length
This is different from C/C++ where we find lengthusing sizeof.

* The elements of array are stored in consecutive memory locations.

ADVANTAGES OF Array
__________________________

* Array are used to store multiple data items of same type by using only single name.
* We can access any elementsrandomly by using indexes provided by arrays.
* Array can be used to implement other data structure like linked list , stacks , queues , tees and graphs etc.
* Primitive type to wrapper classes object conversion will not happen so it is fast.

DISADVANTAGES OF Array
__________________________

* Fixed size : we need to mention the size of the array , thus they have fixed size. when array is created size cannoit be changed .
* Memory wastage : There is alot of chances of memory waste .
suppose we create an array of length 100 but only 10 elements are inserted then 90 blocks are empty
and thus memory wasted.
*strongly typed : array stores only similar data type thus strongly typed.

* reduce Performance : the elements of array are sorted in consecurive memory locatiobnns
thus to delete an element in an array we need to travrse through out the array so this will reduce performance .
* no methods : array doesn't have add or remove methofds
